# poke-team-builder

## About: 

- This is an web app using the pokemon API. The development of this app is for an educational purpose.

- The app is made using Webpack for development dependencies, React for front-end and axios for the API calls.

- I use the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co) for data and get the pokemon images from the official [Pokemon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) websait. I do not own any of the data and images used in the app.

## Functionality:

- Pokedex for all regions
